# Virtual-Cookbook
# Introduction
Virtual Cookbook is a Python-based application that lets you manage ingredients, organize a pantry, and build recipes to be stored in the cookbook. It models real cooking workflows using object-oriented design and can check whether a recipe can be made with the ingredients you have. It can also return a list of all the recipes you can make. You can simulate cooking a recipe to remove the required ingredients from the pantry.

# How to Use 
Download the files in this repo  
Run:  
```python 
main.py
```
You can now navigate through the cookbook using the buttons in the windows shown below. You can select a recipe or ingredient by clicking on them. When you exit the cookbook, all of your recipes and ingredients will be stored in a file titled cookbook_data.JSON
